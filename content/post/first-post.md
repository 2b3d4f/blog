In the land of text, where words roam free,<br>
Asterisks twinkle like stars in the sea.<br>
Dashes dance in rhythmic grace,<br>
While headers rise to mark their place.

A single backtick, a whispering tone,<br>
Code blocks stand in a quiet zone.<br>
Lists unfold like a path unknown,<br>
Guiding steps through a syntax throne.

Bold and italics, a tale they weave,<br>
Stories hidden for those who believe.<br>
Links like bridges to distant shores,<br>
Lead to places, to ideas and more.

In the gentle space of Markdownâ€™s art,<br>
Every line is a work of heart.
Simple strokes in a digital rhyme,<br>
Capture moments in the canvas of time.
